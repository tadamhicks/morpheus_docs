=== Multitenancy

A very common scenario for Managed Service Providers is the need to provide access to VMware resources on a customer by customer basis. With VMware several administrative features have been added to ensure customer resources are properly scoped and isolated. For VMware it is possible to assign specific `Networks`, `Datastores`, and `Resource Pools` to customer accounts or even set the public visibility of certain resources, therefore allowing all sub accounts access to the resource.
