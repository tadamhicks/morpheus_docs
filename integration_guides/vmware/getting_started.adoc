=== Getting Started

To get started with vmware, simply start by adding a Cloud in the `Infrastructure -> Clouds` section.

To start adding a VMware cloud there will be some things you will need:

* *Vcenter API Url:* Typically this is the url to the Vcenter web client with a `/sdk` in the path
* *Username/Password*: A set of credentials with high level access to VMware (ensure the account has Datacenter level access)

Once these fields are entered, some selections will start pre-populating. A cloud integration must be scoped to a specific data center and cluster. If the drop downs do not populate, please  verify the api url and provided credentials have access to Vcenter.

Another cool feature provided with the cloud integration is optional `Resource Pool` scoping. One can choose to allow the cloud to provision into All Resource Pools or a singular Resource Pool. When choosing `All`, these Resource Pools can be managed from a sub-account and visibility perspective via the Cloud Detail page (multi-tenancy).

The VMware cloud integration provides a few additional options including allowing users to make host selections or keeping that aspect hidden such that the best host is automatically chosen for the requested provision.

The *RPC Mode* feature can be configured to allow {morpheus} to install its agent on the Guest operating system via either SSH/WinRM or Vmware Tools Guest Process feature. The VMware tools Guest Execution API can be tricky so it is recommended to use SSH/WinRM if possible. However, if it is not possible for the Appliance to have outbound access to all networks in which VMs are being provisioned to the SSH/WinRM ports (22, 5985 respectively) then Guest Execution is the only option.

The `Use VNC` console option on the VMware cloud requires special configuration on each ESXI host but allowed hypervisor level remote console support. (See the Advanced Section for details)

When following this add cloud wizard an option will be presented to create a group or add to an existing group. These groups can be given provisioning permission via  role based access control. It is normally recommended that groups are organized such that one cloud exists in one group unless the networks are setup such that internal routing is possible between the clouds. This is very useful for bursting, or hybrid cloud configurations.

==== Existing Instances

{morpheus} provides several features regarding pulling in existing virtual machines and servers in an environment. Most cloud options contain a checkbox titled '*Inventory Existing Instances*'. When this option is selected, all VMs found within the specified scope of the cloud integration will be scanned periodically and Virtual Machines will be synced into {morpheus}. By default these virtual machines are considered 'unmanaged' and do not appear in the `Provisioning -> Instances` area but rather `Infrastructure -> Hosts -> Virtual Machines`. However, a few features are provided with regards to unmanaged instances. They can be assigned to various accounts if using a multitenant master account, however it may be best suited to instead assign the 'Resource Pool' to an account and optionally move all servers with regards to that pool (more on this later).
A server can also be made into a managed server. During this process remote access is requested and an agent install is performed on the guest operating system. This allows for guest operations regarding log acquisition and stats. If the agent install fails, a server will still be marked as managed and an Instance will be created in `Provisioning`, however certain features will not function. This includes stats collection and logs.

NOTE: All Cloud data is resynchronized on a 5 minute interval. This includes Datastores, Resource Pools, Networks, Templates, and Virtual Machines.

==== Service Plans

A default set of Service Plans are created in {morpheus} for the VMware provisioning engine. These Service Plans can be considered akin to AWS Flavors or Openstack Flavors. They provide a means to set predefined tiers on memory, storage, cores, and cpu. Price tables can also be applied to these so estimated cost per virtual machine can be tracked as well as pricing for customers. By default, these options are fixed sizes but can be configured for dynamic sizing. A service plan can be configured to allow a custom user entry for memory, storage, or cpu. To configure this, simply edit an existing Service Plan tied to VMware or create a new one. These all can be easily managed from the `Admin -> Plans & Pricing` section.

==== Virtual Images / Templates

{morpheus} will automatically take an inventory of all templates configured in Vcenter and present them as options during provisioning. However, in order for {morpheus} to properly provision these virtual machines and provide accurate stats and health of these virtual machines, an agent must be installed during virtual machine startup. This means remote access needs to be granted at the guest operating system level to {morpheus}. To properly configure these virtual images, find the relevant images in `Provisioning -> Virtual Images` and edit the entry. On this form, a few options are presented. The first is a check box asking whether or not cloud-init is enabled. If cloud-init is enabled, simply provide the default OS username configured (for Ubuntu the username is `ubuntu` and for CentOS the username is `centos`). For those looking to add cloud-init to existing templates {morpheus} requires no special configuration and can use the default `cloud.cfg` settings.

A global cloud-init username/password can also be configured per account as well as a keypair via the `Admin->Provisioning` settings section. The great benefit of utilizing cloud-init is default templates do not need common credential sets thereby increasing provisioning security.

Windows systems do not typically support cloud-init. So simply turn this checkbox off and provide the `Administrator` credentials. It should be noted that these credentials are encrypted in the database. If using WinRM for the RPC Mode instead of VMware tools, a Local or Domain Administrator account credential set can be provided instead.
