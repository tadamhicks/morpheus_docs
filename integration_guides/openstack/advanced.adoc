=== Advanced

There are a few advanced features when it comes to provisioning on top of Openstack. Most of these present themselves in the provisioning wizard. They include OS Volume Type (Local or Volume). This basically dictates wether the main OS disk is copied and run off the hypervisor or remotely mounted as a volume via Glacier. Some openstack setups only configure hypervisors with minimal local disks so Volume type is needed.

Another option during provisioning is "Assign Floating IP". This option does exactly what it says and is similar to the feature on the Openstack instances dashboard itself. It should be noted that this will attempt to acquire a floating IP from the project and if out of capacity will attempt to increase capacity to the project if the cloud credentials provided have sufficient administrative privileges to do so.
