==== Workflow Execution Phases

For VMâ€™s, Pre-Provision and Provision execute after the VM is running. Pre-Provision can be used for a template so it is added before a script set at the Provision phase executes. Pre-Provision for scripts is mainly for Docker as you can execute on the host before the container is up. Post-Provision will execute after the entire provisioning process is complete.
