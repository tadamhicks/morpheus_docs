Identity Sources
================

Overview
--------

There are several built in single sign-on integrations included with
{morpheus}. These can be configured via the ``Identity Sources`` button
in ``Admin -> Accounts``. These integrations include linking
capabilities with LDAP, Active Directory, Okta, and Jump Cloud. One can
even map these sign on tools to equivalent roles in {morpheus} so at
first log in users are assigned the appropriate role.
