=== Blank Dashboard

Problem:: A blank dashboard or 500 error after installing morpheus

NOTE: A blank or 500 error on just the dashboard is different than the entire morpheus-ui not loading. Please see UI note loading article for troubleshooting the ui not loading after an upgrade.

Cause:: Elasticsearch restarting prior to being fully bootstrapped during the initial install.

Solution:: To fix, purge elasticsearch by running the following on the {morpheus} Appliance:
[source,bash]
----
curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/*" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://localhost:9200/*
morpheus-ctl restart elasticsearch
morpheus-ctl restart morpheus-ui
----

Another option is:
[source,bash]
----
sudo rm â€“rf /var/opt/{morpheus}/elasticsearch/data/morpheus
morpheus-ctl restart elasticsearch
morpheus-ctl restart morpheus-ui
----

If you get a term/timeout on ui restart, run
[source,bash]
----
morpheus-ctl kill morpheus-ui
morpheus-ctl start morpheus-ui
----

NOTE: The morpheus-ui may take a few minutes to load and be available after being restarted
