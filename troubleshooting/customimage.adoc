=== Unable to provision a custom image

Prior to provisioning an custom image, the image must be configured in the Provisioning -> Virtual Images section by selecting Edit on the Actions dropdown of the Virtual Image.

In the Edit Virtual Image pane:

. Select "Cloud Init Enabled?" only if the Virtual Image is a linux image with cloud init installed.

. Enter the username and password that are set on the Virtual Image.

NOTE: When using Static IP's or IP Pools in VMware, VMware tools must also be installed on the template in order for {morpheus} to set the static IP address when provisioning.

NOTE: {morpheus} agents only support 64-bit vm's at this time.
